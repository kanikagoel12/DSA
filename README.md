# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice journey**, where I solve and document problems from platforms like **LeetCode** and **GeeksForGeeks** in a structured and topic-wise manner.

The purpose of this repository is to strengthen **problem-solving skills**, build a solid **DSA foundation**, and maintain a clean reference for **revision and coding interviews**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build strong fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms
- Practice problems in a topic-wise manner
- Maintain clean, readable, and well-documented solutions
- Prepare for **coding interviews, internships, and GSoC**

---

## 📝 Problem Format
Each problem file contains:
- 🔗 Link to the original problem
- 🧠 Explanation / approach
- 💻 C++ solution
- 💻 Java solution
- ⏱ Time and space complexity analysis

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository
- Browse problems topic-wise
- Use it for **quick revision**
- Understand common DSA patterns such as BFS, DFS, Two-Pointers, and DP
- Refer to solutions in multiple programming languages

---

## 📈 Progress
This repository is updated regularly as I continue solving and documenting new problems.
